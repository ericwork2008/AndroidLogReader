When I analysis Android adb log, I need a tool which can highlight or filter to show checkpoint
text. The tools is created for this purpose.

1) All the filter can be defined by regular expression
2) Filter can orginazied by Group
3) You can add plugins which can add extra hint text for the log.

In the development, I get more idea on the java programing in the following website, great thanks for the owner.
